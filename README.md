# Kuffner-Sternwarte-Lightmeter

Alternative driver for the Kuffner-Sternwarte Lightmeter Mark 2.3,
written in Python. More information on the hardware can be found at
[the Kuffner-Sternwarte wiki](http://kuffner-sternwarte.at/hms/wiki/index.php5?title=Lightmeter). This
driver requires pyusb and works similarly to the original driver which
it is based on. It will be improved soonish :)
